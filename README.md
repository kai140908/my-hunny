# Happy 6th Monthsary, hunny!!

Can you believe it’s already been half a year? Six months of loving you, missing you, growing with you, and holding onto every message, every call, every little laugh we’ve shared — even if it’s from miles and miles apart.

I know being in a long-distance relationship isn’t always easy. There are days where I wish I could hold your hand, hug you tight, or just sit beside you and say nothing at all. But even through the distance, you’ve made me feel closer to you than anyone ever has. You’ve shown me that love doesn’t need to be physical to be real, and deep. It’s in every "good morning" message, every late-night call, every random “I miss you” that hits right when I need it most.

You being in Canada and me being here... it’s tough sometimes, but you make it worth it. You’re worth every second of waiting, every time zone difference, every countdown to the day we’ll finally be together in the same place. I can’t wait for that day, and I promise — it’s going to be everything we’ve dreamed of and more.

Thank you for being patient, loyal, silly, strong, and full of love. Thank you for letting me in and allowing me to be yours. I wouldn’t trade what we have for anything in the world.

Here’s to six beautiful months and to the many more ahead of us. I love you endlessly, and no distance will ever change that.

Counting down the days until I can finally look you in the eyes and say this in person:
I love you so much Chloe, more than words can ever say.
